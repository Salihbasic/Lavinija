Whitaker's WORDS, now in Kotlin.

# About

Since the original WORDS program was written back in the '80s and '90s, it has
received practically no updates or modernisations. The original code was poorly documented and
massive, thus proving hard to modernise or adapt into newer frameworks and technologies. 

# Current status

As of this moment (1st of August 2022), the program supports:

* Fast search of words and inflections in the dictionary (completely goes through Ovid's *Metamorphoses* in ~900 ms)
  \[qu- pronouns are an exception]
* Handles u/v and i/j alternations without any issues
* [Uses JSON to handle dictionary and inflection data](https://github.com/Salihbasic/whitaker-words-jsonisator)

No further development is to be done on this project, as I have personally abandoned it.
If you wish to fork the project or use any part of its code for your own development, feel free to do so.
